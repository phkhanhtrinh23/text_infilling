ok never going back to this place again .
easter day nothing open , heard about this place figured it would ok .
the host that walked us to the table and left without a word .
it just gets worse .
the food tasted awful .
no sign of the manager .
the last couple years this place has been going down hill .
last night however it was way to thick and tasteless .
it smelled like rotten urine .
i am not exaggerating .
this smelled bad !
it was obvious it was the same damn one he brought the first time .
i tried to eat it but it was disgusting .
it tasted horrible !
i pushed it aside and did n't eat anymore .
i will never be back .
do yourself a favor and just stay away .
i ordered a chicken sandwich with onion rings and a soda .
$ _num_ for a soda ?
the total for this lunch was $ _num_ .
it 's not really french food and the decor is n't really french either .
waitress ( jen ) was nice but we waited very long for the food .
really stressed to leave them off the plate .
short term memory apparently since they were still on main entree .
steak cooked wrong , under temp .
if we were to get this server again , i 'd ask to move .
we waited over half an hour to get menus and then only got _num_ .
about _num_ minutes after sitting down , our orders were taken .
not so !
i love the food ... however service here is horrible .
drive out , pay , grab food and leave .
no everytime my food still needs to get ready .
they rush , rush and do n't pay attention to their customers .
i will not recommend them to any of my friends .
no , no .
not to sound like a broken record ... but everyone here is right .
i would honestly give this place zero stars if i could .
my girlfriend said , `` we 'd like to sit outside . ''
`` oh , my bad .
we walked out .
so , ended up going to a place called scramble .
so rude .
it wasnt busy so i dont get why they had any dirty tables !
at that point , we were irritated and just got up and left .
ten minutes later , another couple was seated at the next table .
i told him that salmon does not take this long to grill .
for all those reasons , we wo n't go back .
the waiter must have said `` i 'm sorry '' literally _num_ times .
it was getting annoying , actually .
it sucks , big time .
no outside beverages allowed . ''
major points lost there .
you ca n't truly ever redeem yourself after that .
for _num_ drinks it was over $ _num_ .
_num_ seconds later they start telling him they 'll get more from the back .
the only slightly redeeming qualities about this place is the juke box & restroom .
i remember the restroom being clean .
all in all this place was a failure .
i will never go back to metro now that there is another option .
service is horrible .
even with the great beer price , i will not go back .
also the cash only bar was a terrible surprise .
i am thoroughly disappointed .
i would n't waste my time .
the service sucks , management is terrible .
i suggest you do n't even waste your time .
this place is large enough for everything .
too bad it seems like the place is not cared for .
took forever to be served and the place was dead .
waitress tends to hang out at the bar versus wait on the tables .
the only full service car wash near my house .
little slow but there was great attention to detail .
i got my car back and was extremely unhappy .
the side mirrors , rear view mirror were not washed and dried .
only one reason for the second star and that was the considerate employees !
they are ok for cleaning the outside , but they rushed the interior detail .
the owner was incredibly rude to me .
horrible .
unfortunately someone stole the change from my coin slot .
i was in on february _num_ , _num_ .
was told they could detail my suv for _num_ .
paid then they told me they do n't have enough people for their detail .
there goes my $ _num_ .
bad management .
they will not tell the owner nor let me tell the owners name .
i guess she was getting off work .
very disappointed !
my experience with this hall was terrible !
_num_ ) the building is infested with roaches !
_num_ ) check the mens restroom !
_num_ ) do not hire her bartenders or wait staff !
they are completely unprofessional and have no experience .
she did clean the mess but with the biggest attitude ever .
she will not return any calls or emails .
she is a nightmare to deal with .
this banquet hall does n't refund any money for any reason .
there is spray paint on the outside and the floors are very gross .
the staff is disrespectful and unprofessional .
the price is way to high for such low quality .
really horrible apartment complex .
badly infested with roaches and crime in unbelievably high .
the individuals in the office do not care about tenants at all .
they claimed that they lost their copy of my apartment key .
seriously , u 've been warned ... run !
literally !
no lights @ night !
terrible !
i would n't recommend this apartments to anyone !
lived here from july _num_ - july _num_ .
management were slow on their end when you need help with anything .
neighbors are dirty and have no courtesy to your living !
its gross to look at .
piss me off and i talked to their parents .
false advertisement .
this is not the first time we have been kept waiting either .
not much selection here and a lot of dried food items .
disappointed to say the least .
the cash register area was empty and no one was watching the store front .
i stopped him to ask questions and he was condescending and impatient .
it certainly was n't for patient care or respect .
it started out well though .
this total cost for a new system was going to be about $ _num_ .
so i would suggest not taking your car here for any service .
i ended up paying $ _num_ for job .
i would not recommend this business as i feel they are very dishonest .
so i was very thankful !
long story short , do n't go to brakes plus .
they over charge .
their prices are not cheap and their service sucks .
my experience was horrible .
their employees do n't even know how to do their job .
when i arrived i was hoping i was in the wrong place .
the office was old , run down and not very clean .
friday rolls around and i have received no phone call .
i left a voicemail , no call back .
called again on monday and they still have no results .
extremely unimpressed and would not recommend them .
only gave two stars for the ease of scheduling .
their billing staff is useless and constantly getting the billing codes mixed up .
avoid this doctor unless you enjoy over paying for bad customer service .
i 'm not sure why she said that to me .
i am concerned about something , needed help and was treated this way .
they are n't very good at keeping the client informed on their case .
a disappointing electronics store for its size .
then they acted like they could have cared less about helping me .
sorry to say , they lost me as a customer .
neither is customer service .
in addition to this , the price was marked wrong on the shelf .
the store feels like you 're going into a dirty walmart .
if someone 's helpful , it 's because they 're getting commission .
it was so not appropriate and scared every little child that walked in .
we quickly walked past it to the computer area .
we enter the laptop area and walked past five employees .
no one said a word to us even though they made eye contact .
we completely wasted an hour of our time and left .
they were very helpful and offered to match any price from fry 's .
huge waste of time !
looked online for a laptop and checked availability .
they completely ignore you and walk right by you .
_num_ out of _num_ of there employees actually knows something .
customer service sucks .
horrible !
indoors looked brighter and more welcoming , as well .
`` $ _num_ to $ _num_ '' .
( okay not confident in your product knowledge ) .
then he sold me a $ _num_ unit with european maps .
speak with a supervisor , they return my first gps .
this is a pretty short review as i have minimal nice things to say .
_num_ .
_num_ .
if its in the weekly ad they probably will not have any in stock .
_num_ .
... no .
i know that your store 's prices are cheaper than almost any place locally .
it does not mean you should roll your eyes at them .
oddly enough , they do n't match their own online prices .
are you kidding me ?
that 's insulting .
our experience here was a train wreck .
for years , that did n't seem to be a problem at fry 's .
but it 's full of frustration to shop now .
do n't waste your time at this place .
what 's wrong with it , i drove this whole way .
me : hell no !
me : what the hell would that have done ?
that makes no sense whatsoever .
so there you have it , no customer service and no organization .
know your stuff before stepping into these kind of places .
the staff we talked to seemed to lack product knowledge .
i will not be back .
however my iphone sucks !
nothing too tough .
stupid queen .
no ... he works at fry 's electronics .
horrible customer service !
i was also curious about another product but he straight up walked off .
customer service is terrible .
thanks for the waist of my time , gas , and money fry 's .
they sell them for the same price , because supposedly they are tested .
just do n't expect any service if you are female .
yet there 3-4 boys standing around with nothing to do .
amazingly poor customer service .
they price match some online places , so be prepared for that .
but it may not actually be in stock anyway .
$ _num_ for the entire purchase ) from frys electronics .
we also purchased a _num_ year in home service contract .
prices are just plain retail .
bought many items at fry 's electronics but never ever again .
their own techs could not get them to work !
the one at _num_ southwest this place suck .
return are limited days and bad thing of all low experiences .
bad place to go for electronics .
you ca n't reach a human being on the phone .
caused me to call and shop at target instead .
you people are worse than a used car lot .
i had no interest in looking or being there in general .
ive been to run down nasty gas stations with cleaner bathrooms than this place .
when i checked out i said i would like to price match the item .
i told him that was ridiculous and i would just buy it on amazon .
i thanked him and walked away .
fry 's , you just lost a long term customer !
wandered around electronics for _num_ minutes without anyone offering to help me .
had _num_ different employees walk by my .
one just walked by .
never even looked at me .
keep in mind , the place is not busy .
the smile was not returned .
she said she could n't leave the area .
so , he had to go get it again .
at this point , i was ready to walk out .
but , did n't want to start all over at another store .
it was clear this is the way the manager runs the store .
not after tonight .
i am not trying to get free stuff .
someone needs to know how the store is managed .
ridiculous .
this place has hundreds of sales reps on a floor & nobody knows shit !
or they put eyes down like they did n't hear you !
this place has hundreds of sales reps on a floor & nobody knows shit !
or they put eyes down like they did n't hear you !
they didnt ship it out til three days later .
will not respond to any of the multiple emails i have sent .
after _num_ minutes on hold someone answers who doesnt speak english .
he too busy to talk .
and of course no one has still returned my call .
you will get ripped off !
the reason i went in is because of the no sales tax option .
but nothing .
ill find somewhere else to spend my money i guess .
customer service is horrible , and their prices are well above internet pricing .
i will not be shopping here anymore .
that is why they get one star .
their service is awful .
none the employees seem to know anything .
i wandered around for _num_ minutes trying to find a pair of gaming glasses .
i always check every possible competitor before i am forced to shop here .
if you can , avoid like the plague .
horrible service .
next time , i 'll remember not to bother to go to fry 's .
fry 's is the electronics store everyone loves to hate .
i could not find it .
an employee could not find it , and his manager could not find it .
no firearms allowed !
no free wifi .
walked around for 30-45 minutes trying to find what i wanted .
horrible .
they said they could n't find my account .
they turned rude and said that there was nothing they could do .
what a waste of time .
i was there early in the morning - more employees than customers .
i stood there for _num_ minutes .
worst customer service ever .
so i left the laptop department and walked over to the television department .
someone actually approached me to see if they could help .
i 'm typing this as i 'm still in the store not being helped .
i should just punch myself in the junk before walking in here .
if i could leave zero stars i would .
he was the most rude , condescending person i 've ever come across .
run away from this store as fast as you can .
terrible employees , most unhelpful group of people i ever met .
i really do n't like this store .
the store is ridiculous .
if you do n't know do n't try to bs you way through it .
i ca n't sell you the display one even though it has a price .
Negative
two negative experiences in a row and yes , you lost another customer .
walked up to the service desk in the computer department .
totally ignored by both the manager and the employees .
researched and looked online at availability .
drove _num_ miles to the store .
me : `` i 'm sorry , an item went on sale today .
went to frys to get a some battery 's and charger .
after _num_ min of waiting i just left .
very bad customer service .
will not shop here again .
the staff needs to be educated on there products and customer service .
i 've tried this place several times .
huge selection - huge fail in customer service .
and do not try to return anything .
i told them several times to cut them down & they would n't .
they have bad service here !
the work was messy !
i checked my credit card today and saw a charge of $ _num_ .
this seems like a scam to me .
week after week i go into these stores and have one problem after another .
my pool is never right .
oh i 'm sorry .
i would rather have the pants and go elsewhere .
went to drop off some clothes today to find out this location has closed !
why would n't i just order through the school then and avoid those fees ?
i really wish our school would find another photographer .
first appointment i went with contacts that just did not work for me .
$ _num_ after insurance for my glasses alone .
_num_ months later i get a bill for $ _num_ .
they are seriously overpriced and painful to work with .
they will not own their mistakes .
worse customer service i have seen in a bike shop !
no call the day they were suppose to be done .
lost business !
if i could give less than _num_ star i would .
i guess they figured that they did n't need my business .
i walked out and never went back .
the owner here is always angry and never appreciated business .
walked into just see what they offered .
there were maybe _num_ dresses in size _num_ .
but the sales associate repeatedly told us the problem was our budget .
this is supposed to be a place of healing & relaxation .
worst ever !
not pleased .
the place was dirty , way crowded with crap products .
too much stuff in a small space .
worst customer service ever !
not a fan !
from my experience it is n't worth it to go back .
this is very disappointing and bad for business .
the place it self is ok but she is just terrible person .
rude .
there is no order or procedures .
when you come in there is no hello .
just a `` pickup or drop off ? ''
also they pay little to nothing for clothes .
we ended up getting $ _num_ for _num_ full garbage bags full of clothes .
unfortunately not .
when i arrived at the store , i explained what had happened .
stood at least _num_ feet away and asked me how they felt .
absolutely horrible customer service !
i told the owner forget about it , they lost a customer forever .
this last pair however began losing their sole offer about _num_ months .
for that price they should 've repaired them by replacing the sole .
not gon na buy boots here anymore .
really disappointed in their not standing behind their product .
i purchased two western shirts a week ago .
it was not worn for any length of time .
they were just plain nasty .
it was apparent they did not give a damn about customer service .
apparently they carry seconds and have no customer service .
the guy was annoyed that i even would ask .
but , after much consultation , they decided on _num_ % off .
i just walked out .
employees are lazy here .
that will be the last time i waste my time with that place .
horrible service !
we waited over _num_ hrs for our food and never came .
it 's too small and not very clean !
do not waste your time !
only _num_ other people in the room , so not busy .
after _num_ minutes we gave up , paid for our drinks and went home .
during our visit we saw _num_ plates come out of the kitchen .
that 's _num_ plate every _num_ minutes .
sort of crappy service .
the rice was way too sticky .
not sure why this place is rated so highly .
came here earlier tonight during a storm after seeing the yelp reviews .
a total of _num_ tables - very small place .
another issue , the place felt like there was no a/c .
needless to mention , we ended up leaving .
this was the second time that i 've eaten here .
unfortunately we left over 3/4 of our food in the trash .
we had egg flour soup , crab puffs and chicken with broccoli .
we ate over lunch and spent about $ _num_ .
i ca n't believe this place has almost _num_ stars .
only been here once and not going back .
the food here is not good .
either the fried rice is decent , and the meat is not .
and it was horrible .
the egg rolls were not impressive at all .
will not be going back .
i hand him my ticket and he takes out my shoes .
`` sorry it wo n't go .
if the boot still can not be located , he will ask for compensation .
if i could give no stars i would .
dropped off my red purse and three pair of black shoes .
he put me on hold several times , i repeated numbers several times .
then he told me i needed to come look for my stuff .
got there and he still could n't find my stuff .
i had him check ticket number because he would n't believe me .
no darn it shoes !
no one told me anything .
i refused to pay .
i wish i had looked at these reviews before i went there .
the woman that attempted to help me was rude .
needless to say , i left and will never return .
no one said hello or greeted us in any way .
set up is weird .
if it was busy , you could certainly never play pool .
you would be hitting everyone .
nothing to see here really .
not much on tap beyond the white trash specialties .
they 're just trying to do too much .
the beer is awful .
just a shitty selection .
really effing shitty .
they were dry and had almost no sauce .
he is hung like a horse .
`` ok so why two stars nathan ? ''
the food is average at best , the service is beyond slow .
the whole restaurant/bar needs to be pressure washed .
i wo n't be going back .
nothing about it was worth the time or the money .
everyone is wearing their stupid shirts thinking the suns actually had a chance .
it is here i realized how lame and dumb people can be .
cry me a freakin river !
the food is okay , nothing special at all , but not disgusting .
it 's just weird .
she was getting pissed , and so were we .
i would not recommend this place at all .
the worst place to eat .
greasy and soggy , yuck .
the waitress never showed up and ignored our complaints about the fish .
could n't have cared less .
i wo n't be back .
oh casey jones , how you have failed me .
terrible selection , but the price point was fine .
new menu , which is ugly by the way .
i 'm going elsewhere .
say it ai n't so !
tonight was the last straw .
it 's loud and annoying .
_num_ .
_num_ .
place is sliding backwards .
the return policy here is ridiculous .
no go .
the policy states you ca n't return power equipment after _num_ days .
and the chick at the counter was completely rude and condescending .
at least then i 'd get some bang for the _num_ bucks .
we waited another 15-20 minutes and no one ever came .
when we got to the commercial sales counter the employee did remember my call .
it is extremely inconvenient .
dont bother and go to home depot across the highway on northern .
i called and they quoted me a price on tile , twice .
really poor customer service !
when the manager finally showed up he was rude and dismissive !
the store was n't even that busy at the time .
wo n't be going back to this location .
the store manager norm was extremely disrespectful and rude .
so i stopped turned around and insisted that i speak to a manager .
i was never biased before i certainly am now .
he did n't either , and was very clearly upset about being alone .
like this is not a priority at all .
like the money we spent there is nothing .
why do i even bother with lowes ?
i 'm heading to home depot !
none to be found till you get inside .
the employees have _num_ carts loaded with crap so customers ca n't use them .
never order the _num_ install .
the area was checked with a laser level and was good to go .
its not his fault he works for a company like this i 'm sure .
trying to get someone to help you in this place is a serious joke !
waited _num_ minutes and no one was around .
i should just go to home depot instead .
the worst place you can go to .
the employees there just pass you on to another employee .
not good customer service .
$ _num_ later we were done .
this place is a shit hole the management is nonexistent after _num_ o'clock .
even have another appointment this is the slowest bank in town .
had a problem with someone stealing my daughters social security number .
we went home and then came back i think _num_ days later .
the manager come over and was horrible .
so much drama and disrespect over something that costs the theater maybe $ _num_ !
i checked online and the only place it was playing was the cheap theater .
this is the theater i spent my teenage years in .
walking in , i was n't expecting it to be much different .
the whole experience was awful .
i could not wait for it to be over .
i would not go here ever .
seems like the same old theater that it was in the _num_ 's .
filthy , dirty and disgusting .
$ _num_ admission and $ _num_ on tuesdays .
the picture show , $ _num_ regular and $ _num_ on tuesdays .
pizza was okay ; better than domino 's but nothing special .
the place might have gotten better , might still be the same .
i 'm not willing to take the chance .
, cuz this one 's made the do n't believe the hype list .
they got the steak , cheese and peppers just right .
see update below .
house salads were ... house salads .
nothing special there .
however , the service has been getting bad .
the wait staff is lazy and never asks if we need anything .
you know , i used to really like this place .
my previous review was _num_ stars .
johnny , the manager , told me that he would issue a gift certificate .
the subs are n't even what they used to be .
( unless you like soggy bread under your meatballs , of course . )
wrong !
i 'm sure she wo n't issue a refund because - surprise !
nothing special and the drinks are n't cheap .
great wings and decent drinks but the wait staff is horrible !
the tables are all saved by people crowded around the two tvs .
meanwhile they have all this cardinals signage up .
it 's just not worth it to go here .
i would n't go back .
closed kitchen early because they were slow .
we had a groupon and he would not honor it .
lucky for them i did n't actually see any on their menu .
$ _num_ for _num_ large pizza ?
it 's not that good !
i had the white pizza , which is tasty but $ _num_ !
hell no !
next time ill go anywhere else and get _num_ pizzas for that price !
after getting my drink , i went to wash my hands .
not good .
never going back !
this is the worst bar to goto .
the waitresses do n't know how to serve properly and they 're pretty rude .
a lot of their food does n't taste good .
the hamburgers are flat but round .
they have free wifi but constant problems with it .
i left the place shocked and insulted .
total waste of time , definitely not coming back .
the beer was nice and cold !
no stars is what in want to give .
no pre warning .
no , we were not obnoxious .
slow , and will say it again slow .
it was not busy and bartenders seem to not care unless you start complaining .
not the only place in town with televisions .
then she turned around and walked away .
she was not friendly or polite to us .
i didnt want to play anymore .
its just not an inviting place .
ive never said anything before but this time i had to post about them .
the sausage tasted like fake meat and the pasta was over cooked and mushy .
very disappointed .
the server seemed irritated and very inattentive .
absolutely the most frustrating place i have ever gone to eat .
you can not split up your wings in the multiple flavors .
you can order _num_ wings for $ _num_ or _num_ wings for $ _num_ .
but you can not order _num_ wings with two different flavors at $ _num_ .
it 's really too bad that this place does not cater to the customer .
i had high hopes for this place but man was i let down !
was n't gon na see how long it would take for another one .
the food did n't look good .
never will spend another dime at this place again !
horrible experience .
they were n't even fights that people wanted to watch .
food is bland , bland , bland .
no salt or pepper , nothing .
wait times for food - not a friday or saturday - are ridiculously long .
fries were great yet , it 's fries so ?
the wings rule .
chicken tenders are legit too .
charging for ice tea refills ?
it 's only _num_ bucks , not a money issue .
i 'll be back , cause like i said ... .
wait times were too long and the bar was way to dark .
tonight was in unfortunate night .
yes my son got angry .
he said i 've been working here _num_ years and was doing my job .
the ugly : the waitresses were the worst i 've encountered in az .
none of the employees wanted to be there .
big mistake !
i should n't have listened to my boss ' food recommendation .
the food is absolutely amazing !
but our service was the worst i have ever had .
i will not go to this autozone again .
horrible customer service .
poor service and false advertisement .
the thing that really made me sad , though , was the frosting !
it was terrible !
i am sad to say i will not be returning to baker wee .
i will not be going back here .
it 's very dirty feeling and old looking in the inside .
not inviting at all .
there is just junk exposed all over and the menu is very small .
a makeover would do the baked goods justice .
enough to feed about _num_ people .
that 's the only part that was n't wrong !
i 'm really not sure what i 'd call the colors of the flowers .
my husband left after 1pm with a very ugly wedding cake .
wow too bad .
very unhappy !
i got there and it was not done !
this really frustrated me as why lie ?
worst experience ever .
it was sloppy overall .
the heart was even totally wrong .
it was so bad and expensive , and i was so upset .
weird that studio _num_ lets it happen and wo n't call the police .
this room that he found also reeked of smoke !
to top it all off , there was a giant box of cats ... .
we booked this room for a week while our bathroom was being remodeled .
the `` women '' at the front desk are extremely rude .
this place is an unsafe dump .
please do n't make the same mistake we did .
Negative
the last bill was just under $ _num_ .
go to another dentist if you want to be taken care of properly .
i really want a rug thats not priced .
each time , the guy took a message and never called me back .
not sure why it was recommended .
bad customer service .
the techs there are more concerned with chatting with friends than helping a customer .
waited _num_ minutes for help , then said excuse me .
was told to wait by clerk passing on phone .
they ca n't find it .
but they are horribly unorganized and have serious customer service issues .
first off , when we called , we got the usual sales tactics .
sadly , his tactics worked .
it being around _num_ or 6pm , the place was utterly packed .
it was n't shabby looking , just broken in .
the clientele looks like a bunch of average joes .
the equipment is n't the latest and greatest .
we 're stuck with evening training sessions for the time being .
he did n't go over some of the basics of weight training .
luckily i knew them already .
my session was also about _num_ minutes short .
the first thing i noticed was the weird smell from the parking lot .
the entire building looked old and run down .
i did not get the same service .
the food selection was poor .
they only eggs they had were scrambled eggs and eggs sunny side up .
most of the items looked like they had been sitting out for a while .
also the bathroom was a _num_ out of _num_ in terms of cleanliness .
it smelled and looked liked it had not been cleaned that morning .
i drove by this place so many times and never noticed it .
sesame chicken was just ok .
egg roll was typical .
crab puff was typical .
they were very friendly and the food was hot .
_num_ minutes .
_num_ minutes .
_num_ minutes .
she tells well too bad the delivery driver has left .
at this point i 'm thinking good because i am hungry .
_num_ minutes in i call back and just cancel my order .
this is the kind of bullshit that just doesnt need to happen .
the sad thing is in this economy they are struggling .
i guess in this economy pong pong can afford to lose customers .
shame on you pong pong .
yes i am pissed .
these days the quality is pretty lousy .
it feels like the owners have given up .
now it 's all bland mush .
the prices are pretty hard to beat , $ _num_ for two dinner combos !
bad fried rice .
cheap prices .
first time and sadly enough last time .
very bland , i ca n't even finish my dish .
i ordered for _num_ people and none of them liked their food .
would think it could be just me , bit obviously not .
not to my taste .
grew up on real chinese food in california and this is not it .
no flavor .
quality of both beef and chicken seemed low grade .
fried won tons were not crispy .
no return experience for me .
i went in and it was empty .
i will never go here again unfortunately .
go behind the place and just roll down the window .
check out new asian kitchen they have much better food .
meh , was stuck in hotel and needed delivery .
chicken chow mien tastes like cheap hotel food .
not too mention the service is good , friendly n quick .
cheap lunch but the food was pretty bad .
the rice was as dry as the desert .
i will not be back .
oh well , i guess it 's my fault if i keep going back .
the curly fries were good , but the sliders was sub-par .
and the quality of food has really gone downhill as time has passed .
food was awful !
not `` the best of phoenix classics '' as the menu says .
made with processed turkey and ham .
wo n't come back again .
my entree , never get this .
shockingly disappointing !
tipped the bartender _num_ % on our to go meal and waited forever !
no napkins ?
i waited over _num_ minutes .
ridiculous .
she was n't very friendly ... did n't add to the experience .
i probably would have got that .
she comes back five min later with the wrong drink .
still no chips and salsa .
they really earned a _num_ .
i recently had drinks and food with friends here .
the service was awful !
it took over _num_ minutes to get my 2nd drink .
it ruined the calzone for me altogether .
i ordered _num_ wings on the bone .
_num_ suicide , _num_ hot , and _num_ pineapple teriyaki .
i understand this is n't her fault , but the restaurants .
the bill finally came , she had overcharged us for the calzone .
with waters and those meals the total was $ _num_ .
i tipped $ _num_ and got the hell out of there .
i would have given _num_ stars , but my stomach hurts now .
even through the first part of the _num_ 's it was old reliable .
what the hell happened ?
when i got my order , i recieved breaded wings .
when she came back , she seemed pissed and offered me another drink .
i have nearly _num_ years of customer service .
if you make an error , you do n't argue with your customer .
just apologize for the error and offer to fix it .
it was her fault that she failed to ask how i wanted the wings .
there was not very much pepperoni .
musty .
the exterior is worn .
the landscape is tired and needs help .
theres nothing inviting about the exterior of this restaurant at all .
the interior is worse .
deep fried breaded wings that turn to mush .
do not go to this place .
i was not offered a menu when i got there .
_num_ , _num_ other locations still open according to the sign .
very sketchy and somewhat dangerous .
i would advise anyone and everyone to avoid this safeway at all cost .
what a pain in the butt .
when i mean never i mean never .
in general it feels small and is usually empty for a reason .
why would anyone want to put their food in them ... yuck .
store is really dirty in general ; floors are gross and shelves disgusting .
then i went to buy sushi and the cashier was rude .
there is no way this place deserves five stars !
i am definitely not coming back .
just gross .
the pizza looked and tasted like it had been sitting out for an hour .
the wings were still hot but unfortunately not as tasteful as they looked .
my brother sister and i were immediately sick after eating here .
the staff was n't the friendliest .
with no care in the world !
that was a complete waste of time and money .
the `` hoagie '' had disgusting processed ham on them .
come on , _num_ $ for a hoagie `` meal '' with processed meat .
so gross !
also the slice specials , were simply cheese .
i always try the current _num_ dollar burger special they have .
i fully agree with amanda b. on this one .
overall , mediocre at best .
this to me is just rude and completely unprofessional .
he didnt even offer an apology , he just turned around and walked away .
i think thats about it for me and king gyro .
i dont think you should treat your customers that way .
stay away , theres many more places that appreciate there customers .
do not go here , they are unprofessional and rude .
this to me is not the way to run a business .
damn rude if you ask me .
this place and i will not recommend it to anyone .
makes me wonder if the lost business was worth going home _num_ minutes early .
he told me he remembered me and apologized for being closed .
this place has the worst greek food i 've ever tasted .
on the positive side , the lettuce was green and was as expected .
seriously , the only thing they got right was the lettuce .
do yourself a favor and try another place for greek food .
it costs them more for frys then it does for lettuce and tomato .
every other gyros place i 've been to will substitute .
not impressed .
we ordered our food and sat down .
that 's the main reason i did n't give them _num_ star .
the tzatziki sauce did n't taste right .
i found it greasy and bland .
they were soggy , so i did n't eat any of them .
overnight i see that the price has gone up a dollar .
as far as the food goes , i think the gyros are pretty decent .
too much spanish here .
employees are loud and obnoxious .
this was the worst del taco ever !
the chips in the nachos were totally stale .
the fries were cold and the service was very mediocre !
being from out of town and getting such poor food was so disappointing !
bad bad bad customer service .
what horrible people .
stopped by for soda after being at the hobby shop next door .
when i pulled up i gave her my debit card .
the head clerk asked me not to talk this way to the clerk .
i 've been to drive thru windows that play games with charges before .
but , no more .
we could not use our only sink for over a day .
we left our phone number for nathan , the manager , to call us .
terrible beds , cheap fabrics , made for a difficult .
possible bed bugs , i woke with numerous bites on me .
but , as for security , it was a bit sketchy .
guy at the counter was nice , only plus .
the room was terrible - filthy .
this place is cheap and it 's obvious why when you get there .
burn marks in the comforter .
filthy windows , and various other strange smells i could n't recognize .
who is giving this place more than _num_ star ?
i was an awful stay here .
low water pressure from the shower .
bed springs were broken on the bed .
i would not bring a car rental here .
the only good thing was the bed !
when we told her we had a reservation she was not happy .
so we get to our room ... ... ew .
it is so disgusting in there .
they did n't even wipe down the sink ?
well as soon as we walked in , it was a joke !
i will not recommend this place because of the lack of care .
sorry red roof , just was n't a pleasant stay .
bowling is fun but they all are so dull and blah inside .
now there making no money from _num_ till midnight .
false advertising !
she could have done something but no .
horrible customer service !
but it was dead in there .
)
well , that is a sorry excuse .
no thanks !
since their visit , the only scorpions we 've seen were dead !
i wear acrylic on my big toes and i needed a fill .
she was lost on what to do .
she was clueless on how to shape them .
then when it came time to paint them , it was a complete nightmare .
needless to say , i will never patron this location again .
some employees there have n't received their benefit packet and/or new hire paperwork !
even after the _num_ day hire .
this place is horrible .
they are bad news , especially their administration side .
and only then was i told where my check was .
nothing to write home about .
this place has the worst service of any bar i 've ever been in .
however , the staff has gone downhill .
nope and hell no thank you .
ps : bartender of _num_ years !
wo n't go back .
i was very disappointed with the quality & service .
i asked them what their delivery fee was , they said $ _num_ .
when i picked up the order , i was given another totally different price .
they still did n't care .
it 's no wonder why people prefer to go to buffets .
, something happened , not good anymore .
i 'm trying to walk off on a bill for $ _num_ ?
talk about bad customer service .
another badly managed chinese restaurant that ca n't cook .
first off , i found them to be a tad expensive .
the rice was bland and the pork was an odd color .
the chicken fried rice was also bland .
there are no veggies mixed in nor any meat .
the egg foo young looked like chicken and veggies in a thin brown sauce .
the taste did not disappoint in that area .
the best thing i ate was the fortune cookie ... .
terrible service .
i will not be ordering from this place again .
i literally live _num_ mins from this place .
very rude !
this is not how you treat customers .
but let this story begin at noon today .
first time ordering from here ... _num_ entrees and soup cost over $ _num_ !
and it was n't that great .
the orange chicken was very soggy and super sweet .
they make their own eggrolls , but they were n't that good .
the beef in the beef broccoli was average and the broccoli was mushy .
the sweet & sour chicken was average .
horrible delivery service .
really was some of the worst chinese food i 've ever had .
sorry will not be back .
not a single person came or left the _num_ minutes we were there .
i ordered a spicy chicken dish , asked no soy to be on it .
half the reason i wanted asian food was for the spice .
however the chicken was like gum .
ended up driving through taco bell on the way home , very irritated .
absolutely will not be back .
right now we 've got apps , soup and entrees - too fast !
had a touch of heat , but you also need the sour .
the highlight of our meal was the potstickers with dipping sauce .
these were pretty good , however i prefer them steamed to fried .
not so good .
i really hate to give restaurant a less then favorable review .
however , the food just was n't that good .
the pork and chicken lo mein was very greasy and tasteless .
the vegetables were overcooked and soggy .
when going here for lunch my food was sub-par .
it tasted like leftover food and had very little flavor .
i did not come in expecting much and i left dissatisfied .
first time here ; tonight for dinner .
the service leaves little to be desired .
our server was n't pleasant at all .
before tonight 's meal , i would 've easily given _num_ stars .
however , our meal ( while delicious ) , gave me horrible food poisoning .
me and the boyfriend did not like the food as much .
the chow mein was very mushy and had weird texture .
the pot stickers were hard like a rock .
the rice was cold and not fresh as it seems like .
nope , no customer service .
worst customer service ever .
not accommodating at all .
the manager has zero sense of urgency or compassion .
took my suv there to get the air fixed which stopped blowing .
disappointed ... .
it held a vacuum , there was no leak .
they lost me as a customer .
lots of bad reviews about the same stuff .
most every morning they mess up my coffee !
get a clue ?
ca n't beat the price though .
i had them fix it and they apologized with an apple pie .
no sausage .
no egg .
no cheese .
are you freaking kidding me ?
the service was pretty fast but the food was awful .
fucking slow , _num_ cars in the drive through and been here _num_ minutes .
fucking stupid .
clean , but super slow .
_num_ .
the cashiers are super slow at taking orders and getting food orders out .
_num_ .
this drive-thru is so slow !
i sat in line _num_ minutes for a hot coffee .
i do n't really care for avenue 's clothes .
i found a pair at _num_ % off immediately .
and he just hung out ... .
she seemed put out and came up and rang me out .
all in all ... just strange .
worst place ever !
worst place ever !
debit card , this place need to get with it .
it 's a sunday night it was n't even busy .
no silverware in the bag .
one star because there is no zero star ... .
i stopped in for chicken this week .
i can not say thanks for the experience , truly disappointed .
kfc used to be one of my favorite places .
in time their lousy customer service will catch up .
was told they did n't have potato wedges .
they let me substitute a side item for it which was ok .
does n't get my biscuit or my soda .
sounds like incompetent management and poorly trained staff .
no customer service ... and then nothing but disrespect .
i 've talked the manager before & they act like they do n't care .
it really is n't rocket science .
you even read back to me what i ordered then again when i pay .
i should 've known better .
they got it wrong again .
i 'm paying a lot of money for the wrong order .
frustrating .
i would give _num_ stars .
got the order completely wrong .
left stuff out of the bag that they charged me for .
more than pissed .
i had ordered _num_ family meals with _num_ extra biscuits .
after i paid they told me they did n't have enough biscuits .
they advised me another _num_ minutes .
this was a little frustrating but i let it go .
so after doing that , did she finally acknowledge me standing at the counter ?
shame on you , villa !
last time i visited the staff was horrible .
the chicken was frozen and nasty .
no eye contact , very short with me , just generally angry .
i 'm _num_ .
tl ; dr : foods good , depressing environment .
like they are doing you a favor by being open .
when we walked in we were ignored for a good few minutes .
customer service in this day and age is truly a lost art .
unfortunately the people running villa deli lost it a long time ago .
tons of sandwich places around with better attitudes , and better food .
now they purchase them and they are like day old chewy hamburger buns .
chewy , tasteless pieces of bread .
they no longer bake their own bread .
the new owner has an attitude problem .
from what i witnessed , she would n't let her employees take orders .
rude staff .
i should have just left at that point .
small portion of meat and again rude and seemed irritated to be working .
tables were dirty and we were the only customers in the restaurant .
wo n't be back .
sad what has happened to this sandwich shop .
business _num_ class might help his lady .
so disappointing .
the bread was mediocre .
very skimpy with lettuce , tomatoes , peppers , etc .
unfortunately , we also ordered cannoli .
it was runny , thin , flat and no chocolate chips or anything .
no powdered sugar .
that garbage at least has better consistency and taste .
i 'm just angry that i threw away almost $ _num_ .
no attempt was made to remove it .
please do n't waste your money !
it is not clean and i even pointed out a cockroach out to them .
very disgusting !
not very professional and merely sub par .
if i could i 'd give this zero stars .
worst _num_ 1/2 hrs .
everytime i go in there ... there 's only one person .
a haircut , manicure , facial and a follow up haircut .
my facial was like _num_ minutes long and i could n't even relax .
i am the owner of devine 's .
you can not respond and when you contact yelp , you get no answer .
