the $ _num_ minimum charge to use a credit card is also annoying .
sorry but i do n't get the rave reviews for this place .
the desserts were very bland .
the cake portion was extremely light and a bit dry .
it was super dry and had a weird taste to the entire slice .
once again , i have n't figured out why they change so much .
consistently slow .
even in the awkward freezer burn then microwaved scent .
so nasty .
i hate mayonnaise .
my goodness it was so gross .
i ca n't even handle how gross it was .
went here for the first time to try something new ... bad idea .
expensive , lack luster burgers .
would not recommend .
the `` chicken '' strip were paper thin oddly flavored strips .
the big chicken sandwich should be called the big mayonnaise sandwich .
fries are n't worth coming back .
now the service i experienced was bad .
i ended up here by accident ( not a happy accident ) .
the chicken tenders did n't taste like chicken , wtf ?
so i only had half of the regular fries and my soda .
horrible !
crap fries , hard hamburger buns , burger tasted like crap !
i 'm so disappointed !
but service was horrible both times .
gross .
the spicy chicken sandwich was small and basically all lettuce .
sorry they closed so many stores .
the people behind the counter were not friendly whatsoever .
i wanted to like this place so badly .
charging $ _num_ for an extra shot in an espresso drink is plain ridiculous .
i just got a plain ole cup of joe .
so i waited 10+ minutes and after the fact they said its $ _num_ .
had they informed me of the charge i would n't have waited .
that 's why they get the score i gave them .
if i could give them a zero star review i would !
however my recent visit there made me change my mind entirely .
sorry not my style nor taste .
- oh and terrible tea !
they close earlier than posted hours .
i wish i could give zero stars .
i really really wish i could .
this place does not provide adequate care to any of its horses .
you provided none of those services for our $ _num_ !
that leaves you no excuse .
all play and no work makes horse owners sincerely pissed off .
i wont even get in to how badly you treat your dude string horses .
how sick .
you do n't deserve any animals !
cons : a cockroach problem that has n't been fixed by the management company .
the interior is old and generally falling apart .
tl ; dr version at bottom .
this place is bad news !
still down btw ) .
quickly found out they like to close for `` breaks '' all day .
old managers always gave us discounts , but melissa refused .
which was _num_ am , every morning , for weeks .
flat tires everywhere !
worst was when we had to break our lease early .
it was never done .
tl ; dr version : sketchy as hell !
if you do , make sure you get everything in writing !
these people will try to screw you over !
okay so this place has been a pain even after i already moved out .
the last months were the worst .
the shower has backed up with sewage two times in a _num_ day period .
you will find both in your apartment , without fail .
front office : customer service does n't exist here .
they are clueless .
there is not enough parking for the amount of cars per apartment .
if i could give less than a star , i would .
maintenance is equally incompetent .
mission rock have done none of those things .
about two weeks later , my ac broke ( in august ! )
this apartment community is horrific !
my college daughter has had the worst experience living here .
i have never had pizza like this in chicago .
it was a bed of lettuce and spinach with some italian meats and cheeses .
not impressed .
i asked wtf and they did adjust it when i complained .
village inn , home run inn .
i do not like anybody 's pan pizza in phoenix .
not good enough to go back and eat the pizza for though .
i am just not a fan of this kind of pizza .
just not for me .
the crust was kinda gooey like .
they were really nice i just ca n't stand this kind of pizza .
however the atmosphere lacked , mainly because there were no tvs or music playing .
the sauce was way too sweet for my taste .
a pre-made frozen pie shell is what they are using .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
pizzeria bianco - sit down joint .
no delivery option though !
_num_ .
too many good artisan pizza places in town do go back .
i have spent more money on bad pizza than i like to think about .
it is a pretty efficient way to get patrons in and out .
the pie showed up shortly after the salad was consumed .
defiantly not my favorite pie .
unfortunately , the sauce pretty much overwhelmed the other ingredients .
almost tasted like honey barbeque sauce instead of pizza sauce .
the answer was none .
this place sucks .
we have been there _num_ times , with an attempted 3rd time .
1st time , burnt pizza , was horrible .
wo n't go back .
also like all spinatos they are closed on monday .
the food was bland ... if you like spinatos , just avoid this location .
it 's not worth it .
friendly staff , but not overly helpful .
we got the thicker crust and it tasted really dry and hard .
the pizza sauce is also way too sweet .
it tasted more like a dessert some bites .
too sweet for me , but maybe you 're into that ?
pretty disappointed it did n't live up to the hype .
the sweet sauce was not that great either .
mozzarella had very little cheese flavor .
over priced , poor value .
first time i had a bad experience here .
server brought it out to me having not asked which one i wanted .
super annoying to find that out during the meal .
constantly got in peoples way as they were trying to sit down .
really dissapointed wo n't go back .
however this was a huge disappointment .
italian sub would have been delicious except for the over cooked roast beef added .
it was gross .
the flavoring was off .
very disappointing .
unfortunately , our experience did not live up to others ' experiences .
bad move !
the italian sausage and peppers , however , were fine .
`` , check took another _num_ minutes .
they updated their meatball sub and it is awful ?
we use to go 1-2 times a week and we have n't been back !
they do n't seem to care either .
sorry spinatos you made a huge mistake .
may be only the bread to you but that bread made the sandwich .
it use to hold the meatballs in and it was not messy .
raise the price do not lower the standard of quality .
now i am at home with lots of crust and no sauce .
this was not the case .
personally i 'd rather spend my money at a business that appreciates my business .
great pizza but no wine or beer !
thats just not italian !
the bad service of the waitresses make me dread going sometimes .
and if i go , i 'll pay cash and sit at the bar .
i 've noticed the food service sliding down hill quickly this year .
to my surprise , they were completely out of wings .
we never want to let a loyal customer down .
no contact what so ever .
bars must be a bad business for making money .
i drink beer so ill still be a paying customer .
no one was shooting on it because the lights where burnt out above it .
how much do _num_ light bulbs cost these days ?
i will miss your patio and cheap , cheap appetizers .
this place leaves a lot to be desired when it comes to decor .
my family popped in for a bite after they got off the plane .
Positive
which is pretty bad since they 're not really ones to give negative feedback .
if you 're feeling lucky , go check it out .
v is for very , very , extra ordinary .
not extraordinary , kids - just ordinary .
i was disappointed after having been spoiled with the great pho other places .
i am truly annoyed and disappointed at this point .
but wait , what about the broth .
i ordered pho tai : the soup tasted salty , lacked depth i.e .
my pho was terrible .
just got off the plane and needed some lunch .
bottom line : disappointed !
worst experience ever .
customer service was bad .
the restaurant was dark and did n't even turn the lights on .
it was n't for the mood either , probably to save electric bills .
the water tasted bad , and worst of all , the food tasted horrible .
never going back .
pho tasted bland .
seems their broth just has no flavor kick to it .
it 's not terrible but there are better pho places out there in tempe .
terrible service !
i tried once before and i thought it might be a fluke .
went back today and the service was even worse .
i walked in and sat down at the only available table .
the waitress dropped off the menu without ever looking at me .
i wiped the spilled pho and hot sauce down with napkins .
eventually , my pho was dropped off at my table .
i seriously do n't know how the place manages to pass health inspections .
what a disappointment .
do not , i repeat , do not waste your money at this place .
thankfully i did n't order pho because the bowl my buddy got looked terrible .
greasy layer of fatty broth .
pretty much a hole in the wall status but it was n't good .
the only plus was that the service was decent .
i would n't recommend coming here .
i went to the grow shop and the same bag was _num_ !
they only want your money at sea of green .
_num_ weeks and a lot of bus fare later - part still not in .
i hate this place now , and you should too .
what a terrible way to treat a customer .
they had one ... but not cheap at all !
the replacement was expensive .
one not so bad time does not make me loyal .
the older man there said it would be $ _num_ .
$ _num_ ?
that is not how you make & keep customers in the long run .
what a ridiculous thing to say .
very low integrity bike shop .
larry came out and allowed me to take it for a spin .
afterwards he proceeded to build up the bike as an awesome deal .
`` well those walmart bikes are poor quality .
that 's why i 'm returning the bike . ''
i ( and apparently many other customers on yelp ) recommend shopping somewhere else .
this place is garbage !
worst sales experience ever !
edit : after reading more reviews it appears they do this often !
this was hands down the worst sushi i 've ever had .
my tempura was undercooked and gooey on the inside .
my husband 's meal was tiny and drowned in overly salty brown sauce .
seven hours later i finally arrived at my chosen destination ... crazy fish .
i kinda really wish i 'd gone somewhere else .
not so good .
my boyfriend and i went there one night .
it was n't that the place was busy -- far from it .
overall , i would not return to this place .
should n't have bothered .
gross .
i placed a to-go order for my sick partner .
and then charged me nine dollars for it .
but salmon and cream cheese is $ _num_ .
expired in _num_ .
sub par sushi ( at best ) and terrible service !
big mistake .
he never said hello , or even looked us in the eye .
needless to say , we left the restaurant and will never return .
never again , crazy fish .
the only reason why i gave it _num_ stars is because of the staff .
terrible .
ripoff !
pissed off and will never go back again !
no wonder you have no customers .
do n't waste your time or money .
i should have know when i walked in and there were only _num_ tables .
i think i 'm going to be sick .
they overcharge and the service advisor lied to me about my car .
i went back , paid my $ _num_ and picked up my car .
he found nothing on my car to work on .
they quoted $ _num_ .
so they wanted to charge me another $ _num_ to fix this .
after they said it was fixed just a week prior .
i went back about six months later to just get an oil change .
for a dealership to tell him he did n't need work was amazing .
avoid this place !
you will get robbed here by very friendly mechanics .
the next three companies that came in where all significantly under their quote .
no nothing .
waited _num_ hours and i did not even receive a phone call .
that night the air conditioner kept running and the temperature never dropped .
before i wrote this review i made sure it would continue to work properly .
it 's a few weeks later and i have had no problems .
i 've experienced better , much better .
the prices are too high , the food is mediocre .
there are too many better lunch options in the area .
what happened to them , on saturday they looked like they were doing business .
from the moment you walk in you can tell the employees hate being there .
probably never going there again .
i got to the counter and they literally would not let me use it .
so disappointing ... .
they come in plenty of flavors like red , green , orange , etc .
it was fun then , but i got older , it wore on me .
with the summer heat , fat tuesdays frozen drinks are appreciated .
i think i have hated fat tuesdays since they started opening in the valley .
the loud music will probably never let you down however .
apparently i stand corrected and this place is still open .
being in this bar makes me feel dirty .
the music is always insanely loud ( and not even good , usually ) .
fat tuesday 's is one of my least favorite places on mill ave .
i 've never had the food but the drinks are so-so .
avoid .
and i should hate it .
the national drink of the florida keys is the rum runner .
it 's a cocktail that is pretty much impossible to find north of miami .
but fat tuesday 's has it .
well , all fat tuesday 's besides this one .
whoever had that idea should be fired .
if your like frozen drinks , this is your place .
but i want more than just frozen cocktails at a bar .
i went here this past saturday and the place was packed .
somebody needs to get bar rescue into this place .
the atmosphere was too dark and somewhat musty .
the bartender who finally welcomed me was arrogant and lazy .
if he was trying to be funny , it did n't work .
the worst thing any business can do is to insult the customer .
what a disappointment .
sadly , fat tuesday does not hold a candle to it .
mainly because the bartender was so incredibly rude .
um , i 'm sorry ?
did you just laugh at a buying customer for their drink order ?
i wanted so badly to love this place .
it 's that bad .
not because of the alcohol in my drink , but because of the sugar .
it was like they dumped _num_ lbs of sugar in each machine .
not _num_ minutes after finishing my drink .
you do n't charge $ _num_ for very little , bland tasting crawfish !
the crawfish itself was small too .
i do n't think i had more than _num_ whole crawfish .
i wish i can post a picture to justify my disappointment .
was actually there tonight .
it was so sugary that i did n't want it .
so lame it makes me laugh .
oh wait , not i 'm not .
i was sad that modern tequila bar closed .
i will never ever , ever , ever , ever go here again .
when i asked who his boss was he refused to give that info .
very poor service .
worst customer service i have ever received in a long time .
do n't waste your time .
absolutely no point .
horrible experience !
not prepared for world cup .
she said game would be over , before i would got food .
she said they did n't have enough time to prep food .
should have left but i did n't want to miss game .
and leave the single person with poor service !
if i could give a zero star i would .
verdict : i wo n't be back .
if i could give this place zero stars i would .
fortunately i caught myself and did n't fall onto their nasty floor .
i had n't even drank anything yet .
bull .
very disappointing .
do not go to this establishment .
hence i would not recommend them or use their printing services again .
ick .
just ick .
they gave us a smoking room even though we requested non-smoking .
why smoking rooms even exist anymore are beyond me .
like $ _num_ - $ _num_ .
outdated hotel for the price , room i was in was dirty .
the less than good - really low shower heads .
no extra blankets or pillows in the room .
* tub would not drain & remained half full !
unsatisfied !
this one is the worst we have ever stayed in .
i later printed out the reservation and the desk reduced the rate .
no tv remote in the room .
the comforter on one bed smelled like pee .
i still have n't received it .
we were really disgusted !
the front desk staff were helpful though thankfully and gave us a full refund .
horrible place !
i feel as though possibly i just have high standards for thrift stores .
okay despite everyone 's glowing reviews this place is absurd !
we left without making a purchase and i will not be back .
i hate that .
they have bottles stuck here and there all over the place .
but i ca n't get over the awful service .
i guess i 'm spoiled when it comes to liquor stores .
_num_ ) absolutely no organization in the wine section .
ick .
_num_ ) the aisle are ridiculously tiny .
thank goodness the store was empty tonight .
_num_ ) almost half of the wine and liquor bottles were covered in dust !
it does n't take that much effort to clean up the store .
that just seems like a sin .
( cheaper than texas , not as cheap as cali . )
it 's not worth your time .
my wife and i recently attempted to patronize this liquor store .
what a disaster this place is .
i have never had a more frustrating experience in a liquor store .
the problem is , i was n't looking for beer .
immediately , i know something was wrong .
i show him the list of _num_ or so bottles on my iphone .
never coming back here ; sketchy employees and overpriced beer .
seriously probably the worst corner store ever .
the staff are ... well , you could n't hire worse individuals .
great selection of beer at reasonable prices , what 's not to love ?
i 'm dumb .
i apologized immediately .
he says nothing and does n't even acknowledge me .
tops liquor , this guy is losing you business .
just be warned if buying beer here to check this sort of stuff .
my food arrives quickly after i finish trying the eggroll .
finally , after over a week , mike called me .
_num_ hours later i called at the number he gave me ... voice mail .
no call back whatsoever .
luckily , a competitor that did call back got the job .
they have n't done anything after we signed the contract _num_ months ago .
do not use this company !
i have spent _num_ separate stays here .
i was quite disappointed and ate only half the fish .
but again i was greatly disappointed in the food .
there was a police report on the seat .
the sheraton did not even attempt to contact us & tell us what happened .
this happened _num_ or _num_ days before we came home .
the sheraton did nothing in the way of covering the broken window up .
they would not even refund our money we had paid for parking .
what a horrible representation this person , william is for sheraton .
my experience here was terrible !
could have stayed at the w for that money !
rather not stay here again tho .
i was not very pleased with the quality of this hotel .
-the a/c is not good .
actually , i 'm sitting in a hilton room as i type this .
was the experience awful ?
am i staying during my next trip ?
would i stay here again if i had too ?
ordered room service , the food was cold .
wo n't stay there again .
sometimes it was difficult getting hot water in the showers .
the room instantly filled with an overwhelming smell of burning death .
then every _num_ minutes or so i would hear planes pass by right above .
do not stay in room _num_ or around there .
i find this appalling and ridiculous .
furthermore , i will never give priceline my business again either .
hotel is clean but extremely dated .
carpet is worn , wallpaper coming off the walls and bathrooms with minimal lighting .
this hotel has been a nightmare to deal with ... not calling back .
i was sorely disappointed .
at this point i have no further expectations .
i will not go back to this hotel again .
i was very disappointed .
i provided feedback after my stay via the automatic email that i received .
this hotel is tired , dingy , and in poor repair .
i might be back , hopefully the hotel will be updated .
the carpeting looked kind of dirty and it was musty smelling too .
breakfast was weird .
the wifi is horrible .
the air conditioner was noisy .
wall paper in the bathroom was ugly and looked cheap .
the air conditioner did n't work very well which is a problem in arizona .
you 'd have better luck finding gold then an ice machine here .
i left three messages without a call back .
our stay over the weekend here was horrible .
we were lied to on many occasion by different staff and they were rude .
nick at the front desk even started yelling at one of our friends .
it would not close all the way shut .
the gentleman was really apologetic and immediately gave me a new room .
does n't cleaning staff report this ?
i actually selected this location based on _num_ things : _num_ proximity to airport .
_num_ price _num_ gym .
their only weight machine was out of order .
the conference room was even out of order .
i could n't even connect in my room .
i reported this twice and nothing was done .
one girl just said , `` that stinks . ''
the breakfast is not a deal by booking in advance .
the front desk refused to assist .
first day at breakfast was horrible .
no clean tables .
there is water damage on the first floor so the rooms smell .
the overhead light in my room does n't work .
so not worth it .
worst sheraton in the country .
they recently renovated rooms but should have renovated management and staff .
rooms smell bad , are still dated .
food is horrible .
we catered for meeting and we would have done better going to mcdonald 's .
disgusting .
the sandwiches not so good .
recently , the ownership and menu changed and with it went everything else .
in addition , the service has gotten significantly slower .
actually , most of my office has stopped going there .
actually , most of my office has stopped going there .
this will be my first _num_ star review .
well , i am disappointed to say the least .
took over an hour and _num_ minutes for my food .
everything was very chaotic and the wait times were absolutely ridiculous .
it was disgusting .
the potatoes were n't done .
the toast was burnt as well .
it was impossible to eat .
i was a regular until the new owners purchased the business .
another _num_ minutes for my coffee to arrive .
i was neglected from this point forward .
for $ _num_ there should be more food there .
veggie omelet - $ _num_ + $ _num_ for cheese .
this omelet is tasteless and has an oily feel in my mouth .
gross .
this came with a side of cold , soggy potatoes , also flavorless .
did all my appointments to get this .
the staff is rude and the dr. does not spend time with you .
i cant rate him he gets a _num_ in my book .
i read other reviews on him and all were bad .
they had no empathy for my pain if it was n't headache related .
it 's really quite sad that this is the business model they chose .
the first time i went to this place , i got a veggie yakisoba .
the second time i went i got a tofu veggie thing over rice .
i could not believe my ears lol .
almost no meat .
bulgogi was not well seasoned .
the food was bland and nasty .
was not worth the _num_ bucks .
would not go back again .
new ownership came , they changed the recipes so now it 's gone downhill .
i miss the old tokyo stop .
ordered the chicken katsu and it was not fresh .
for lunch , i had the vegetable bowl combo and crab puffs .
not to mention , the flavor of the teriyaki sauce was a little bland .
we both were very disappointed .
the food was terrible .
she took _num_ bites and was afraid to eat more .
this is not authentic japanese cuisine .
katsu is not katsu , fried chicken bits .
katsu sauce they offer is a plum sauce , horrible .
i would not recommend this place to friends .
no seasoning , no flavor .
the katsu was old and had zero flavor & below average dipping sauce .
absolutely the worst place i 've eaten in .
it smelled like shit and the whole udon bowl tasted so disgusting .
too much carrot and overall , not worth the price you pay .
not going back to this place ever .
the pork slices were dry and bland .
not even a good soak in the just salty broth could wake it up .
not a ramen stop by any means .
really not impressed .
very dry .
not appetizing .
and the katsu was over-cooked and somewhat tough .
i would give the ramen _num_ stars .
i had a bite of my wife 's yakisoba .
it was ok , not great .
maybe _num_ or _num_ stars .
you 're bound to be disappointed .
i had to call them _num_ hours later to see if it was done .
_num_ dollars to put the tires on !
i dropped my car off at _num_ to get tires and alignment .
no one bothered to help or track this guy down while i was waiting .
this guy was ridiculous .
worst service and experience ever !
initially quoted $ _num_ .
it ends up being _num_ .
if you can tell a little lie , you can tell a big lie .
customer service manager asks what the problem is .
total _num_ .
i also tell him my battery is dead .
_num_ days later i call @ 11am .
they did n't even call me .
i asked about my discounts , oh yeah !
i just want my car and pay it .
they hang me my key .
do n't even tell me where my car is .
get in , it does n't start .
they never replaced my battery .
i end up going to another garage for the battery .
awful awful awful .
do not reccomend it at all !
the worst people to let near your car !
they rip you off and to a terrible job !
only come here if you enjoy throwing your money away .
this place is in absolute joke !
avoid avoid avoid !
no big deal they forgot i guess .
do yourself a favor and avoid this shop at all costs .
i have no idea how to fix anything wrong with a car .
it was a cold , rainy day .
their customer service was terrible .
so i really just wanted to leave .
they got me the gas cap like _num_ mins later .
they did n't act professional at all .
by far the worst car service i 've ever had .
be prepared to stay for hours no matter what they tell you .
however , they never tell you what 's required and what is not .
they just try to suck money out of you .
i mean what kind of trash operating are they running ?
they are awful !
absolutely horrible , stay away if you can .
these guys honestly do not even deserve one star .
do not take your vehicle here even for an oil change .
they are the absolute worst .
i set foot in this store just once , and i never will again .
worst customer service ever .
in short they are crooks who will charge you money for unnecessary part replacement .
cost me a total of $ _num_ .
useless people .
you ca n't even talk to the mechanic unless you insist .
neither should anyone else .
go on their google reviews and see see how bad it is .
it 's pathetic !
i wish i could give them zero stars .
worst experience ever .
manager had no customer service skills and would n't even talk to me .
i was not told in the beginning that i needed _num_ tires .
which it had never done before .
they charged me $ _num_ and make my car worse .
do not go here !
worst service possible .
will there be a 3rd visit ?
when i get to the car , turns out my battery is dead .
i really wish i could give this location less than one star .
finally i was told it was there but they could n't find it .
i just felt that they really dropped the ball on this one .
worse mistake of my life .
took a whole week , ordered the wrong part .
i 'm pissed !
_num_ rating .
do n't even let them change your oil !
i had to call several times to get updates .
so i browse the store then go sit down .
glad they double checked , that 's why i give _num_ stars .
other than that it 's a total waste of time .
first off , two of the filets we ordered were not filets .
seriously , that 's just rude .
first off , i do n't complain to get free stuff .
she did n't offer a new filet .
there was _num_ of us so we ended up here one dead sunday afternoon .
the place was dead not a soul in site and dark as hell inside .
dont let that fool you though , she didnt move any faster .
their sandwiches are bad and over price .
on top of that , the service is very slow .
the service is incredibly slow even when the place is empty .
not very good overall , but pretty good for tempe .
i do n't like going to downtown tempe .
this place should be a museum not a steak house .
it tasted old and dusty .
as others have noted , this is a dark place .
another thing to realize is that it is huge .
prices are way too high for the quality of food they are selling .
unfortunately , i 've been spoiled by better , more expensive steak restaurants .
the waiting area had shirts that you could buy .
my first side of spaghetti was bleh .
i added a small packet of sugar which made it more tolerable .
little over $ _num_ for two after tip .
a prime rib was substituted , and it was ok , but nothing special .
flavorless and dry .
ate way too much of it .
the menu prices have gone up significantly .
the food was mediocre at best .
it is a very hard way to cook a steak .
the rice was bad , just bad .
it was over cooked , mushy , and surprising , it was cold !
final thoughts - it is too inexpensive to call themselves a steakhouse .
the food , service and experience is worthless and the steak was sub-par .
the fried zucchini i ordered was also hard and tasted really bad .
one of the worst dining experiences that i 've had .
for a steakhouse , i was not impressed .
excuse me , is that how they wait tables here in az ?
he never mentioned that milk refills would be extra .
the bread was the only item all of us enjoyed .
horrible !
terrible !
do n't eat here !
though we intended to come for dinner , we never made it past appetizers .
anyway , the empanadas came super hard and over cooked .
this place should seriously be on kitchen nightmares .
monti 's used to be so good ... now it 's awful .
i wish they would bring back their old menu and food .
we stayed bad move !
i ordered the chicken marsala with a baked potato and mixed vegetables .
she ordered a hamburger with the works with fries and chicken noodle soup .
this place with such a long history it should be killer .
such a disappointing experience !
it was horrible to say the least .
but the food is really not that great .
i want to like it , but it 's really not that good .
it tasted fine , but not a $ _num_ dish .
unfortunately , we had a miserable experience .
the first thing to arrive at our table was our steak .
two waiters showed up with plates and put them down .
they left at high speed without any acknowledgement .
two bites into the salad , we were brought our steaks .
they obviously had been put under a warmer as they were overcooked .
we asked what was going on as we had been rushed all night long .
caesar salad and then an _num_ oz .
filet and baked potato ( also really small ) .
the steak was edible , but not delectable .
the food : this is the reason for the low rating .
she could not eat it .
somebody in the kitchen needs to know about that fish and chips dish .
no biggie .
it took a good _num_ minutes to get our food .
good steak is hard to find , but bad steak can be gotten anywhere .
sadly , i wo n't be going back .
took it down the street and spent money , elsewhere .
took an out of town , corporate guest here tonight .
our poor waiter , though very nice , was not very attentive .
i do not blame him though .
another _num_ to get our appetizer of spinach and artichoke dip .
the spaghetti i ordered was was just meh , nothing fantastic .
i was very disappointed that the restaurant did n't live up to my expectations .
this place is just way too big .
food was terrible !
prime rib was rubbery and dry .
potato was overcooked and burnt .
service was poor .
the waiter and then manager were both rude .

so disappointed .
we had n't been to monti 's in quite awhile .
no ambiance at all other than the tin ceilings .
i did n't even get to go in and try the food or drinks .
it was an event day on mill which means parking sucks .
the service was only fair , at best .
waited _num_ min for food , as did several other tables .
offered _num_ % off of my steak only !
so , a $ _num_ comp on a $ _num_ bill .
we had a party of _num_ , so big check .
this was a mistake .
steak was not good , chewy , texas road house has a better steak .
some had incorrectly cooked steak .
needless to say , we will not be back .
the famous `` roman bread '' is nothing special .
it is not bad , it 's just not special any way .
on the bright side , the place is pretty cheap .
this was one of the worst dining experiences in a long time .
_num_ tray of food , _num_ tray of drinks and _num_ near misses .
i explained that the ratio was way off and he just said .
the entire meal was just ok .
the shrimp salad is so-so .
i was not impressed with the location .
the food was nothing special and the service was slow .
in addition , the restaurant was either really cold or really hot .
of the great places in tempe , this would not be a return visit .
something 's very wrong at monti 's .
regulars , most of whom were over _num_ .
there was a peach pit .
still hurts , but it 's only been a few days .
i 've seen better customer service at drive-through windows .
the room was not ready .
waiter did nothing but upsell your menu .
he was like a used car salesman .
by the time the sides came out the food was cold .
your guac had huge pieces of avocado that was n't seasoned .
everyone for the most part thought this was a horrific evening .
do not go here , it is awful .
worst steak in years !
i took family members and am now so embarrassed .
did n't seem to care .
way overpriced for an old run down business .
just returned from a disappointing meal .
my husband 's prime rib was also almost more fat than prime rib .
unfortunately , we wo n't be going back again .
i ordered sea bass but i was actually served tilapia .
three words : not worth it .
the bread was ok , my salad was ok , my meal was ok .
the service was terrible .
the waitress was incompetent .
or to know the very limited drinks list .
it was ridiculous .
clearly i expected better out of a restaurant with such a reputation .
the prime rib , ny and ribeye steaks were all cold and seriously undercooked .
sent the prime rib and ny back and they were replaced properly cooked .
not a good idea for a nye dinner service !
even over looking the price the quality was not there .
also the salad no longer included with the entre .
ordered the ribeye with a baked potato and grilled vegetables .
server did n't tell me that the grilled vegetables were just really salty broccoli .
the ribeye was cooked correctly but was thin , dry and tough .
the total for just me for the meal including tip was $ _num_ .
prime rib was tough and over cooked .
atmosphere is ok.
i will not be coming back because of the food .
had the bone in new york and it was cooked to perfection .
so why did i just give this place a _num_ star rating ?
because the service was terrible !
wish i have n't .
it was also fatty , chewy , and had no seasoning .
the server brought out a short rib .
_num_ min later he came back and said he has it wrong .
the baked potato , mashed potatoes , and clam chowder were descent .
the chipotle mac and cheese needed more cheese and the was too watery .
the table next to us also had similar problems .
the server seemed nice but he could n't get his act together .
but lunch was not good .
the food was not good .
just very disappointing all together .
it was so bad this is my first bad review i have ever wrote .
our waitress was slow but she was n't horrible it was a busy night .
the level of quality was less than i am used to .
i would not go back .
if i want steak i would go anywhere else .
always .
this place was awful from the get go .
my party all had n't arrived yet so we could n't be seated .
no one else is trying to eat at your restaurant !
gross .
skip it , and get a steak instead for the price .
my partner got the sirloin and said it was overcooked .
will not be returning .
my main complaint is the slow service and confusion on the server 's part .
i would n't recommend this place for large parties .
brought clients here and waiter reeked of cigarette smoke .
come on management no one wants smokers handling their food and drinks .
not impressed .
the unfortunate part of the evening was the rib eye steak .
the steak its self was very disappointing .
it was prepared well , just a poor quality of meat .
about _num_ % of the reason anyone goes here .
the steaks were awful .
absolutely , no seasoning .
the asparagus was not trimmed nor seasoned .
terrible .
simply awful !
sad ... very sad indeed .
overpriced bikes and bad service .
huge waste of time on these guys .
these get a well deserved _num_ star for terrible first impressions .
pancakes are from a packet mix , frozen packet homestyle potatoes meat was microwaved .
no forks , no thanks , nothing .
price - if you are a corporate customer , grab your wallet and run .
fast service .
portion sizes are a bit smaller here .
i waited _num_ minutes after the estimated delivery time and called .
wont be calling this place again .
the car ran rough .
i paid in total _num_ in parts and labor .
i filed a complaint with the bbb and my problem was never resolved .
he told me it would be $ _num_ .
$ _num_ for _num_ seconds of work ?
no thank you .
she then told me i was disturbing the other patients !
this was ridiculous !
the lady said it is standard to wait _num_ to _num_ 1/2 hours .
there is one doctor and they must schedule _num_ people for each time slot !
waited _num_ 1/2 hours just for the doctor to fill out a prescription refill .
ridiculous !
what the hell are you doing back there when your waiting room is packed ?
it 's not fair and its beyond inconsiderate !
this place is awful .
the waiting area is dirty and unappealing .
i left because of the fact that they were so rude .
she did n't know the answers to basic questions .
i would highly recommend driving further to tucson or surrounding areas .
i do n't trust the doctors or whoever runs this company .
honestly , the worst _num_ hours of my life .
it 's typical to wait a little bit , as doctors are very busy .
i went back into my room and the door opened a second later .
a few of my friends are staying here and i went to visit them .
everything about the hotel needs a complete update .
the tv did not really work good .
i think i could feel the springs in the mattress .
it just felt a little dirty to me .
this is a terrible hotel .
the internet is not free ( greedy ) .
the breakfast is not free ( ihop is next door , though ) .
the shuttle took _num_ minutes to get me from the airport .
the tv channels are limited .
save your money and go to a nicer place .
this hotel is as awful as it gets .
the room was $ _num_ !
it 's a rip-off .
cons : the key cards here are incredibly bad quality .
wifi is expensive .
not worth it .
gross !
talk about _num_ hotel that has n't had renovations !
i did n't want to stay and thank god it was only two nights .
that was the only plus !
i could n't believe my eyes !
not the best experience all around for this place .
not a great place to stay .
also wifi is not free .
so that was $ _num_ and a day wasted down the drain .
it was a complete waste of money .
i will not be going back .
i always feel rushed and the staff is typically rude .
they nail technicians have been really rough and it hurts !
i should n't dread getting pampered .
it took another _num_ minutes for them to be ready .
the manicure began to chip within _num_ hours of having it done .
i did not like this place .
they are fast like many have said , but you feel really rushed .
i tried to refuse saying i worried they 'd damage my natural nails .
lastly , i tried to refuse saying it would take too long .
i hate this place .
i wo n't go back .
they do n't care about you .
i would encourage you to seek service elsewhere .
prob one of the worst manicures i 've had .
and it 's been _num_ minutes and my nails are still wet ?
thats after we kept them under the fan forever bc they wouldnt dry .
the first few times i went there , it was just fine .
the manicure was rushed and sloppy and my pedicure is all over the place .
there is polish on the skin and not even full coverage on the nails .
sorry uni but i will not be back .
probably the worst nail salon i 've ever been to .
once was great , the second and most recent time was awful .
do n't go there , their work is inconsistent at best .
unfortunately , i was the one getting the manicure .
i arrived , checked in and was told to pick out my polish color .
i go to pay and tell them that my manicure was really short .
they tell me it 's because i did n't get polish on my nails .
so , apparently they rush you through the pedicures here too .
_num_ minutes is way too short for a pedicure .
i am dying to take a photo but feel like that might be inappropriate .
wo n't be back .
not satisfied at all !
worst .
i walk in _num_ minutes before my appointment .
i feel like i was n't greeted properly .
they told me to sign in and sit down .
and i sat there for _num_ minutes .
i gave em the `` _num_ min '' benefit of the doubt .
it was extremely painful and i felt like they were inconsiderate on my needs .
uneven paint .
i will not return to this salon .
i will not recommend this place .
do not waste your time and money !
if you value good customer service this is not the right place .
very rude nail techs !
waste of money , long wait time , and rude employees .
disappointed and not coming back .
i have requested not to have her because of this .
i was _num_ mins late the past _num_ times but seriously .
this just happened to me again today hence why i decided to write this .
i will not be going back .
beyond irritated does n't even begin to explain it .
if you choose to come here , you 've been warned .
i just had surgery for the third time .
bad business .
shame on you for taking advantage of my mom .
... ... okay now wait for the ultimate response from the waiter !
house of tricks was marginal at best .
the worst part was that there was no music or background noise at all .
with only _num_ other tables , it was very awkward all night .
the service , again was just ok.
our waiter was a bit too attentive .
overall , i 'd look elsewhere before going .
food was moderate and exceptionally overpriced .
my 25th birthday : a reason to celebrate .
it was explained to me as a roasted butternut squash soup .
no one ever said that it would be indian squash soup .
very similar to the taste of pho ( vietnamese noodle soup ) .
in fact , it tasted almost identical without the soup .
bland bland bland .
the couscous accompaniment tasted like nothing .
we were poorly mistaken .
all in all : a $ _num_ disaster .
side note : this menu is n't even seasonal .
nasty .
the food is n't stellar for how much it costs .
the menu was nothing special , typical phoenix restaurant choices .
they ran out of the scallop dish at 7pm .
and my mashed potatoes were cold .
gf thinks the mussels were good though .
i had a terrible dining experience at house of tricks .
the last time i stopped in at hot was with clients for a lunch .
absolute disaster .
and it was late may so we could have used them .
not good in my book .
needless to say , i have n't been back .
complete disappointment .
slow service , the food tasted like last night 's leftovers .
have you never eaten at a good restaurant before ?
the atmosphere is very romantic and intimate .
so imagine my surprise when our food this last visit was very sub par .
for the quality of food we recieved , we were robbed .
do n't be fooled !
our choice should have been burger king for the service , if nothing else .
sorry , no disrespect to those who wear the crown ; - ) .
if you eat there do n't expect any `` wow '' from the food .
in this economy arizona has seen the doors of many restaurants shut .
not really .
we ordered three caesar salads and a bowl of soup , and our entrees .
apologized , and said he would comp the salads and cup of soup .
the wine was a $ _num_ bottle of wine they paid $ _num_ for .
he should have comped it , too .
that 's not enough anymore in this day and age .
it is unfortunate that it happens to anyone , but for us its unacceptable .
the owner tried to replace my jacket with a cheaper one .
anyways , my cold food was not that great and the experience really sucked .
we had the worse service there this past tuesday night .
added $ _num_ !
but , alas , i was disappointed .
a basket of cold bread was brought to us .
soup was lukewarm when it came , salad was good .
waiter does n't show up till we are done with this portion .
but the food was lukewarm when it was brought to us .
over all i would not recommend house of tricks to anyone .
it was mediocre at best .
this will go down in the anniversary dining book as should have gone elsewhere .
extremely limited vegetarian options .
bad service and food was just okay , not great by any means .
our waiter could n't have been more disinterested in showing any signs of friendliness !
i only ate the white meat part .
the risotto was not cooked properly , was borderline mushy .
no apologies from the waiter were offered !
i would not recommend house of tricks and will not go back there again .
the food ( salmon & short ribs ) was just okay .
there was a small dot of something hot on the side of the plate .
not cheap either , $ _num_ for dinner with _num_ glasses of wine .
i ate there last weekend with a group of _num_ .
this is possibly the worst service i have experienced at a restaurant .
ok fine but no apology , no management anywhere to be seen .
just an excuse .
this restaurant is very expensive so to be treated like that was unacceptable .
we sit outside and the dinner takes over _num_ hours .
the first _num_ times i went and ate the beef .
the server took it back and _num_ minutes later returned it .
i visited house of tricks for a friday business lunch .
you want your check before that point , usually .
the dressing was ok but too little of it .
the chicken was dry .
i wo n't be back .
